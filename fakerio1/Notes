handcrafted parts list ("bill of materials")

1 input wire assembly with anderson powerpole connector
1 rectifier diode - 1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003, 1N4004, 1N4005, etc.
1 self-resetting PTC fuse, 0.5 to 1.5 amp
1 electrolytic capacitor, minimum 16 volts, 47uF.  (can be higher voltage or up to 470 uF)
2 0.1uF ceramic or monolithic capacitor
1 7805 linear regulator
1 LED for 5v power indicator; preferrably yellow or orange
1 resistor for power indicator.   typically 2.2K, less if not bright enough

One for each "DIO" header; quantities for a 4-port board:

4 three-pin 0.1" spaced header; approx. 0.4" tall posts for cable connection,
  tails long enough to solder
4 red LED for signal
4 resistor for red signal LED; typical 2.2K, less if not bright enough
